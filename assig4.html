<h2>Problem: <strong>Rosters</strong><br>
<br>
This assignment. involves a program made up of several Java classes:</h2>

<p>Your task is to finish Roster.java by replacing each line marked “// replace this line with your code” with code that makes the method do what its comment says it does. There are 5 such lines.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>An object of class Course represents a course, e.g. 198:111. A course has a department number and a course number.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>An object of class Student represents a student. A student has a personal (first) name and a family (last) name.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>An object of class Roster represents a particular section of a course. A roster has an array of students, an int numStudents, that says how many students there are in the section, an int stopPoint that gives the maximum number of students that may be in the section, and a course that says which course this roster is a section of. Note that the students are not in any particular order in the array, but they will be in the first numStudents elements of the array.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>The class TestRoster that has a main method that can be used for testing Roster. There will never be an object that is an instance of this class.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some rules to follow</h2>

<p>You <strong>may not</strong> change Course.java or Student.java. (You will not be handing these in, anyway.)</p>

<p>You <strong>may</strong> put any code you want in TestRoster.java to test your code. (You will not hand this is, either.)</p>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> replace each of the lines in Roster.java marked “replace this line”. (Replace them with as many lines of code as you want.)</p>

<p>You <strong>may</strong> add methods to Roster.java as long as they are private.</p>

<p>You <strong>may not</strong> make any other changes to Roster.java.</p>

<h2>Handing in</h2>

<p>Upload and submit <strong>only</strong> the file Roster.java as the answer to this assignment.&nbsp; Be sure to upload the version with your code, not the version you downloaded. <strong>Note</strong> that the assignment is due late Sunday night / very early &nbsp;Monday morning.</p>
